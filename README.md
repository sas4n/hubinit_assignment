## CRUD

The goal of the assignment is to showcase your coding skills and ability to develop features. This is a highly important part of the hiring process, so it's crucial to put effort into this without making it too bloated. Reviewers will put weight on three main aspects: code quality, maintainability, and testing. Based on the results of the assignment review, we will make the decision on proceeding with your application.

#### Requirements

Your task is to write a SIMPLE CRUD to manipulate the object called **"blog"** in the Django admin in addition you need to create two front pages one for adding a blog and one to display blogs containing buttons to delete/edit a blog , and customize the __localhost:your_port/__ page using the given **index.html** located in the **carousel folder** (Consider it as you are integrating a template).

### Specification

##### Pages details

- the front page uri for **"blog"** list : /blogs/list
- the front page uri for **"blog"** add :/blogs/add
- the / uri should just contain the index.html content located in the **carousel folder** within this repo and nothing else .

### Excellence Point (Optional)

- Usage of __RichTextField__ instead of __TextField__ for the __blog_text__ attribute.

### Expectations

When reviewing your code, we will focus on the part that fulfills the requirements explained above. We would love to see a well-tested and readable solution.

Pro tip: When you think you are ready with the assignment, take at least a few hours break, and then go through the code one more time before returning it.

### Submitting the assignment

Make sure to edit the __readme.md__ to mention steps(without explanation) we need to follow to examine your finalized assignment.

Push your code to your personal GitHub account and contribute to **our repository**.

A good check before pushing your task is making sure the project works well, using the steps you define in readme.md. Forgotten dependencies and instructions can sometimes happen even to the best of us.
